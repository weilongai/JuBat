# JuBat
A Julia-based framework for battery modelling. 

Jubat is based on Newman's battery models, including the P2D model, the SPM and the SPMe. All equatins are solved by the finite element method (FEM) with 2nd order elements. Jubat enjoys the benefits from Julia language for speed and 2nd order FEM for accuracy.

Jubat is a compact, readable and fast framework for battery modelling and will be useful for the rapid development of advanced battery management system.

Thermal model and degradation models are under development.

CONTRIBUTE:
All contributions are welcome. Please add all essential (and least) functions and one example to demonstrate how to use them. One can add papers to the Citation.jl, so that the contribution can be acknowledged.
